# ChemARise
ChemARise is a free mobile app for Android and iOS for educational purpose.<br/>
It contains a library of chemical structures that can be visualized in 3D and interacted with to apply rotation, translation and scaling.<br/>
The app also proposes an augmented reality mode (AR) to detect via the camera some chemical structures from target images that may be inserted in course material, flyers, posters, screen, etc.<br/>
This app is designed to help students and researchers visualize the spatial arrangement of atoms in molecules to better understand concepts such as chirality, steric hindrance, or symmetry.<br/><br/>
A collection of target images may be downloaded from https://github.com/rlavendomme/ChemARise/tree/main/target-images<br/><br/>
ChemARise is available on 
- Google Playstore: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LCO.ChemARise
- Apple App Store: https://apps.apple.com/be/app/chemarise/id6459995288
- GitHub release for Android: https://github.com/rlavendomme/ChemARise/releases

  ## Development repository
  ChemARise is build with Unity and uses Vuforia to detect images in AR. Most code comes from Unity and Vuforia and will not be stored in the present GitHub repository. Original C# scripts developped for ChemARise will be shared on this repository.
